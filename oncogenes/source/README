This directory contains all files related to the source oncogene data.

The xls file is directly from the oncogene folks.

The plain 'oncogenes' file is a line-delimited list of all oncogenes.

The oncogene-[1-5] files are 5 separate pieces of the oncogenes file. They were
used to gather orthologs from Isobase. (Isobase choked when given all onco genes
at once.)
