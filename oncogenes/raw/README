This raw directory contains data retrieved directly from the Ortholog 
databases. The idea is to use 'extract-yeast-[db-name]' scripts from the parent 
directory to yield a list of yeast gene identifiers. Finally, gene-list-stats 
can be run on the output of extract-yeast[db-name].

InParanoid
==========
The sort-of exception is InParanoid, in that its raw data is manufactured and 
not straight from InParanoid. InParanoid data was retrieved using my 
Ortholog BioPython module, which was translated into several CSV dumps. The 
relevant CSV dump is inparanoid-yeast-and-human.csv. The others, 
inparanoid-all.csv and inparanoid-yeast-human-all.csv are supersets of 
inparanoid-yeast-and-human.csv. The former has no restriction on species while 
the latter contains orthologous clusters that contain EITHER yeast or human 
genes. (In contrast, the useful CSV file, inparanoid-yeast-and-human.csv 
contains only orthologous clusters with BOTH yeast and human genes.)

Isobase
=======
The Isobase data was retrieved in 5 separate queries since it choked when given 
all onco genes at once. The final raw file that should be used, isobase.csv is 
a simple concatenation of isobase-[1-5].csv.

A similar work-around was used for all genes in the chrom bio data set.

RoundUp
=======
Currently, the roundup raw data is not used. In order to be used, an identifier 
translation problem needs to be solved. (Uniprot -> SGD systemtic yeast 
identifiers.)
