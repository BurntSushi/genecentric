Pruning
=======
Add an option to do Jaccard index pruning a little differently. Right now,
the Jaccard index between two BPMs is defined as the size of the intersection
between both BPMs divided by the size of the union of both BPMs.

The other way to do is to do it on a module-by-module basis instead of a BPM
by BPM basis.
