INTRO
=====
This is an extremely naive web site implementation. It was built to maintain
a small set of pages, a user guide, and some feeble support for counting how 
many times people download our code.

It uses the 'tried and true' approach of encapsulating HTML in header and 
footer PHP files, and the content files are simply structured like so:

  <?php require_once('includes/header.php'); ?>

  <!-- HTML for specific content here -->

  <?php require_once('includes/footer.php'); ?>

It isn't pretty, but it will work for a small web site.

BUILD PROCESS
=============
When the genecentric repository is pushed to Tufts, there is a post-receive 
hook that checks out the current master tree, copies the contents of the 'web' 
directory into /r/bcb/public_html/genecentric, and manually updates the 'files' 
and 'docs' directories using my local machine.

The general process is OK, but the details need to be changed. (i.e., stop 
relying on my local machine.)


THINGS THAT ARE BUT SHOULD NOT BE
=================================
The 'docs' directory is automatically copied from my local machine. It is built 
whenever I manually tell it to build.

Distributions are manually built. They should be automatically built by 
checking out a tag of the repository.

The 'files/data' directory was populated manually, once. It should be 
auto-updated.

The 'download stats' are kept in /r/bcb/genecentric/download-{linux,win}. It is 
an extremely simple approach that is only meant to give us a "general idea." 
Use Google Analytics for the rest.
